            <h2>ONLINE DESIGN BRIEF</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Our Design Brief is the start and one of the most important steps in the process of creating a great kitchen.</p>
            <p>A thorough Design Brief is key to creating a successful design, one that will add another dimension to your home, your life. It is vital for us to understand the unique characteristics of your kitchen project, all your aspirations, and how the kitchen space relates to your lifestyle.</p>
            <p>In advance of your Online Design Consultation we have prepared the following questionnaire. Predominantly as a prompt to stimulate your thoughts and generate debate with all involved, the information will also provide our designer valuable content to help guide our discussions.</p>
            <p>This is your kitchen and we want to make it perfect for you.</p>
