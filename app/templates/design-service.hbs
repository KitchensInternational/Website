                    <hr class="mb-5">
                    <p>Our Pre Design Brief meeting is the start and probably the most important step
                        in the process of creating a great kitchen. Once we have been invited to tender,
                        our skilled designers will get to know all your needs and wishes.
                        We understand how you use your current kitchen and how the space relates
                        to the rest of your home. We become aware of your lifestyle and discuss
                        the aspirations you have for your new kitchen space.</p>
                    <p>We talk about furniture, appliances, work surfaces, lighting and colour.
                        We encourage you to be honest, outspoken and imaginative as you like.
                        Bring magazine clippings, material samples, even the colour of your favourite jumper.</p>
                    <p>This is your kitchen and we want to make it perfect for you.</p>

                        as far as we're concerned. Naturally, your kitchen comes with a full guarantee.
                        But we've gone further than that. At the time of installation we have logged the
                        full serial reference number of each and every appliance in your kitchen.
                        This information is then uploaded to our computer and a hard copy is created
                        and filed in your aftercare manual, this ensuring any subsequent service
                        requirements can be dealt with efficiently and without fuss.
                        We want to make sure that your kitchen is everything you hoped it would be,
                        now and for years to come. Even when its yours, we treat it like its ours.</p>
